URL dispatch routes

The route names and patterns are listed here.
The routes are wired up to view callables via the view_config decorator, which attaches a view to the route name.

For example, the 'instances' route name is connected to the Instances landing page as follows...

    @view_config(route_name='instances', renderer='../templates/instances/instances.pt')
    def instances_landing(self):
        pass

# Simple container to hold a route name and pattern
Route = namedtuple('Route', ['name', 'pattern'])

urls = [
    Route(name='dashboard', pattern='/'),
    Route(name='login', pattern='/login'),
    Route(name='logout', pattern='/logout'),
    Route(name='instances', pattern='/instances'),
    Route(name='instances_json', pattern='/instances/json'),
]
